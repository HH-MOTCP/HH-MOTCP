# A concrete hyper-heuristic framework for MOTCP(HH-MOTCP)


## Introduction

<p aligh="center"> Heuristic algorithms are widely used to solve multi-objective test case prioritization(MOTCP) problems. However, they perform differently for different test scenarios, which conducts difficulty in applying a suitable algorithm for new test requests in the industry. A concrete hyper-heuristic framework for MOTCP(HH-MOTCP) is proposed for addressing this.  </p>

## Dataset

The Dataset we used :

SIR: http://sir.unl.edu/portal/index.php
